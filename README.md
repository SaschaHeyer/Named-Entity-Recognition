# Named Entity Recognition with Kubeflow and Keras 

> Now officially part of Kubeflow examples https://github.com/kubeflow/examples ðŸŽ‰

This example demonstrates how you can use Kubeflow to train and deploy a Keras model with a custom prediction routine. 

## Goals

* Demonstrate how to use Keras only models
* Demonstrate how to train a Named Entity Recognition model
* Demonstrate how to deploy a Keras model to AI Platform
* Demonstrate how to use a custom prediction routine
* Demonstrate how to use Kubeflow metrics
* Demonstrate how to use Kubeflow visualizations 

## What is Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition is a word classification problem, which extract data called entities from text.
