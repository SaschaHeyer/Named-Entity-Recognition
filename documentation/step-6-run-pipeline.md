## Run your pipeline

### Open the Kubeflow Notebook
The pipeline can be created using our Jupyter notebook. First we have to create a Notebook in Kubeflow. 

Open the Jupyter notebook interface and create a new Terminal by clicking on menu, New -> Terminal. In the Terminal, clone this git repo by executing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kubeflow/examples.git
```

Now you have all the code required to run the pipeline. Navigate to the `examples/named-entity-recognition/notebooks` folder and open `Pipeline.ipynb`

### Configure the pipeline

The pipeline need several parameter in order to execute the components. 

* `model_path` - 
* `model_name` - 
* `model_version` -
